# BhojanGPT: Explore Indian Cuisine with AI

Welcome to BhojanGPT, a Streamlit-based application that leverages artificial intelligence to explore over 6,000 Indian dishes from our Cleaned Indian Food Dataset. Users can input a list of ingredients, and BhojanGPT will generate a ranked list of dishes with matching ingredients. Choose any dish from the list to get detailed recipe instructions, including ingredient quantities and total calorie count.
